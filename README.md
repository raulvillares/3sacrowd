Directions: Put an alien tile in every empty square until you **fill the whole board**. But be careful! You must **<font size="3" color="red">avoid 3 adjacent same colored tiles</font>** (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).

[Play a demo here!](https://raulvillares.github.io/3sacrowd/index.html)

Some squares are fixed and you are not allowed to put an alien tile at that location. However, you may use those squares to your advantage. Because sometimes **creativity needs constraints**. ;-)

The game is entirely developed with [Vanilla JS](http://vanilla-js.com/). [RequireJs](http://requirejs.org/) is used for modularization. The purpose of this project is to **learn** so **anybody is welcome**. Are you looking for some easy javascript project to make your first [contribution](https://akrabat.com/the-beginners-guide-to-contributing-to-a-github-project/) at Github? **This may be the one!**
